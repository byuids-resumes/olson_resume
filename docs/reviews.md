I liked that you gave a section for your Activities and Interests, it makes you more personable.

The only thing I noticed that I would change is capitalizing "baking" on the last line, but I think that would be more of a preference thing (though maybe one way is more correct than the other).

I guess one other thing you could change is the README file so it has pertinent information for your resume should an employer see it.

It looks great! Good job(is what you'll get with it..... get it?? cause it's a resume for getting jobs....  :)
